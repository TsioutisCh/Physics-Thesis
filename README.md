In this report we examine synchrotron radiation from electrons and protons as explanation
of the non-thermal high energy emission from kiloparsec-scale relativistic jet in M84.
At first we provide an overview of the theoretical background of synchrotron radiation and
then we present the computational process and its application to observational data from M84.
We find that there is a relative lack of analytical report in the bibliography regarding the coding
of synchrotron spectrum therefore we give an extensive description of the techniques and
computational process we used for our model. The observational data reveal that the radiation
spectrum requires more than two spectral components due to turn over at approximately
100GHz. In order to explain the spectral components we investigate two scenarios that require
a population of electrons and protons. Although our models can fit the observed spectral energy
distribution, we need more theoretical work to explain the origin and properties of the particle
population.
