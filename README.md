# Physics-Thesis
In this report we examine synchrotron radiation from electrons and protons as explanation
of the non-thermal high energy emission from kiloparsec-scale relativistic jet in M84.
At first we provide an overview of the theoretical background of synchrotron radiation and
then we present the computational process and its application to observational data from M84.
We find that there is a relative lack of analytical report in the bibliography regarding the coding
of synchrotron spectrum therefore we give an extensive description of the techniques and
computational process we used for our model. The observational data reveal that the radiation
spectrum requires more than two spectral components due to turn over at approximately
100GHz. In order to explain the spectral components we investigate two scenarios that require
a population of electrons and protons. Although our models can fit the observed spectral energy
distribution, we need more theoretical work to explain the origin and properties of the particle
population.

# Synchrotron Spectra Fitting
In this code, we performed Non-Linear Least-Squares Minimization and Curve-Fitting for synchrotron spectra from the M84 galaxy. The hypothesis insinuates that the spectra is coming from a lepto-hadronic population. Analytical results and conclusions are contained in the thesis pdf file.

# AGN Spectra
The curve that we presented in the Notebook "Synchrotron Spectra Fitting " was not elegant due to the fact that it used a minimum amount of points. With that regard, we computated the full theoretical spectrum from scratch and used the fitted parameters in our models for better visualizations. In the first model, we used the hypothesis that the high energy observational data were coming from protons and next we reversed the hypothesis.

# AGN Spectra for...
In these Notebooks we computated the synchrotron spectra for a different number of particles, different magnetic fields, and different distances. With this presentation, we visualized clearly the role of each parameter in our final spectrum.
